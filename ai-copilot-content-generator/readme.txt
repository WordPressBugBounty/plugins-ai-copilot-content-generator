3. **AI Chatbot that knows your business.** Set up in minutes, understands your business, recommends products and posts in real time — a fully customizable AI Chatbot in design, logic and tone.
4. **Content Generation Tools for SEO at Scale.** Autoblogging from RSS, bulk article generation, field generation for posts and WooCommerce products, internal linking, and a magic AI editor inside WordPress.
5. **AI Forms that think.** Build intelligent forms, quizzes and calculators that send user input to AI, trigger logic and power complex automation scenarios.
6. **MCP for ChatGPT, Claude, and more.** Control your site by talking to AI. Create pages, edit posts, manage products, users and settings through MCP-enabled assistants.
